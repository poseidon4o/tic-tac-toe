# tic-tac-toe


## Usage:
 * Compile and run
 * Start the server
 * Start AiClient with 1st argument IP of the server and second optional argument the number of AI players (Optional step, only if you want AI players in the server)
 * Use TextClient or netcat or any text TCP client to connect to the server using port 8090 and play!


## TODO
 * Add logging - alot of it!
 * Fix minmax algorithim, it is ugly and inefficient - all possible boards can be precomputed and level can be simulated with random chance.
